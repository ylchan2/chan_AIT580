I found that hospitalized patients by age group graph is distortion. The colors of the red,blue and purple are almost the same. It is so hard to see the different colors. Especially when we see the graph at the bottom number of local cases by age, the color is so much different and it is so much easier to see.

At the local case in the last 28 days by severity of condition graph, 99.7% is asymptomatic and mid symptoms. The graphic basic has no meaning. I canâ€™t see anything out of this graph. We can also see the number at the bottom is not adding up to 100%.
