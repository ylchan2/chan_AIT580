Rock Chan
-------------
My name is Rock Chan. My email is ychan2@gmu.edu. I am currently living in Asia and planned to come back to America to study for my master degree. My family lives really close to GMU. I enjoy programming.I have worked as an enterprise resource planning programmer in a printed circuit board manufacturing company for over 4 years now. My job now mainly analyzes and writes the enhancement requirements for the ERP system. Testing, source code quality control has become my daily job. I still write programs and mainly for bug fixing and testing. Java, .Net, Microsoft power BI and Microsoft SQL server are the main tools I use in work. 
 My goal for this class is to learn more about artificial intelligence and of course pass this course. Since I can’t go anywhere in this pandemic, I want to find a way to spend my time wisely. I truly believe the world is leaning more toward information technology now. I use Microsoft Power BI for my current job. I don’t know if the job training counts as a course or not. Other than Power BI, big data is really new to me.
I graduated with a degree in computer engineering. I have worked at my current job for over 4 years now. In this job, my company mainly uses Microsoft cloud service. I learn a lot in cloud SQL, cloud virtual machine and some business intelligence features. Throughout my other job over 10 years, I mainly program in Microsoft environments. MSSQL and .NET C# are the main tools. 
I don't mind having a teammate with the final project but you need to know my time zone is utc+8 which is 11 or 12 hours opposite for East America. We can meet online in the morning or at night.
